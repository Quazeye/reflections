What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is added.  It needs to be done so that git sees it as a repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where I can put files I want to commit and it doesn't have to be all the files in the directory.
It lets me select what files I want and don't want to commit at this time.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add a file or files to the staging area and then think about if it is logical to have these changes
at this time.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I want to make some experimental changes to a file.  This would leave the master branch intact while letting me
experiment on a seperate branch.



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It allows me to see where the branches branch from and see the whole structure of the repository and the parent of
each branch.



What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is a branch that contains the changes from both files.



What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

The pros of automatic merging is it helps by showing you when there is a conflict and saves time.  Manually can
take a long time to look through all the changes.
