What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is added.  It needs to be done so that git sees it as a repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where I can put files I want to commit and it doesn't have to be all the files in the directory.
It lets me select what files I want and don't want to commit at this time.
