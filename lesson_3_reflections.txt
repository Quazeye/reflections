When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I wanted to collaborate with someone or if I wanted to use more than one computer when working on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would have more control over which files or branches are in sync.  I may not want to have every commit synced
all the time.
