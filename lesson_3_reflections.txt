When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I wanted to collaborate with someone or if I wanted to use more than one computer when working on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would have more control over which files or branches are in sync.  I may not want to have every commit synced
all the time.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is used if you want to make changes to a repository but not mess up the original.  A clone is a copy of a 
repository either coming from a remote or from your own computer.  A fork is a copy of someone elses repository on
github.
