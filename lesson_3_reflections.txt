When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I wanted to collaborate with someone or if I wanted to use more than one computer when working on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would have more control over which files or branches are in sync.  I may not want to have every commit synced
all the time.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is used if you want to make changes to a repository but not mess up the original.  A clone is a copy of a 
repository either coming from a remote or from your own computer.  A fork is a copy of someone elses repository on
github.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I could compare changes to see if there are conflicts.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

We would send code to each other and have comments about changes in the code.  It would be harder because
it is a manual process.  It could be easier in the fact that we wouldn't have to figure out how to use
github.



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?


When you don't want to mess with master and try out some changes before putting them in the master branch.
